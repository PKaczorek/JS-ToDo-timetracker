# JS-ToDo-timetracker
Simple To-Do with timetracker.
In this project i've linked back-end with front-end, by coding in JavaScript.
In this app we can add new tasks with descrition, assign operations to them and set time we need to finish them.
Function "Add task" is right at the top, under it we have few examples which are showing us what each of option looks like such as "Example of Opened Task", 
"Example of Closed Task". Each Example has their own explanation what we can do with every Task.
Time mesurements i used in this app are +15 minutes and +1 hour, also time for each operation is shown right next to our operation description.
Each task has two or less option (Finish and Delete).
Each open operation has option to add time or delete it.
Under each opened task we have "Add operation".
Closed tasks can only be Deleted from list.
